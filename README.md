# **Image Creation with GANs**

As part of a computer vision course I got the chance to develop a DCGAN from scratch using the pythorch library (with Python of course).

## How to run it

To run it is pretty easy, just clone the repo (feel free to delete the results image in the results folder) and run the *gan.py* script, thiw will automatically download the CIFAR10 dataset and will start the training process of both the **Discriminator** and the **Generator** (if you have a powerful GPU or GPUs is better as it takes quite a long time).

**N.B**: Check the results folder in the repo for some examples of art creation (only used 25epochs, the more epochs the better result, the more time it takes :))
